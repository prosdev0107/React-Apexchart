This right here is no ordinary technical assessment, this is a project based challenge to test real industry skills. 
Let’s jump into it and see what you have to build!

To be precise, this challenge will test your limits in terms of attention to detail, code clarity, code quality, code reusability, communication and much more.

If you’re happy with your results, we’ll send your report to more than 20 companies. If not, we’ll show you what you’re missing and help you get to the next level.


See this page over here, that’s exactly what you’re building. Not kind of like, not slightly similar to, but exactly this page. That’s your goal. Who’s this page for? 
Any company that has high standards when it comes to attention to design and quality of work. 

In this challenge you'll be building the chart component that is a part of a next generation dashboard page. As a front end developer, you must be comfortable with paying attention to detail that the designer has laid out. Like this gradient color, the timeline, and the spacing and as well that the dates are correct. 

This is only a one hour challenge based on a real work scenario; you see, your senior full stack developer was going to do it himself, but he’s swamped with work and has told us that he trusts you to do it for him. He wants to be able to re-use your work, so let’s try to build this out in a component based fashion.

To create the chart data, create a fake data json to stream data into the chart.

Your solution will be judged by your superiors. Similar to how it would happen in a company situation. We’ll provide you a list of requirements upfront. This will give you an indication of what they’re looking for. When you’re finished, they’ll evaluate the work on requirements and provide you feedback with rooms of improvement if needed. 

To get started, we’ve prepared a git repository for you. Simply clone it and off you go!
